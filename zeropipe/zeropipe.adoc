= zeropipe(1)

== Name

zeropipe - wrapper for other programs which can take NULL-separated lines

== Synopsis

*zeropipe* _COMMAND_ [_ARGS_]...

== Description

Programs use stdin/stdout for processing newline-separated data, but sometimes a newline could appear in data without being a record separator.
Some programs can use NULL-character-separated data, but the arguments to specify NULL-separated data often vary and it's easy to forget.
When *zeropipe* wraps a program supporting that, it passes the correct argument.

_COMMAND_ can be one of::
* *basename*
* *dirname*
* *find*
* *fzf*
* *grep*
* *head*
* *locate*
* *ls*
* *sed*
* *sort*
* *tail*
* *uniq*
* *xargs*

Other _ARGS_ are passed verbatim to _COMMAND_.

== Examples

....
zeropipe find -size 0 | zeropipe xargs rm
....

Remove empty files, but support filenames containing spaces and newline characters.
